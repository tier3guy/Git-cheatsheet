# Git Cheatsheet
##### ‚ù§ Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers collaborate on projects of any scale.

## What is a Distributed Version Control System?

- A distributed version control system is a system that helps you keep track of changes you've made to files in your project.
- This change history lives on your local machine and lets you revert to a previous version of your project with ease in case something goes wrong.
- Git makes collaboration easy. Everyone on the team can keep a full backup of the repositories they're working on on their local machine. Then, thanks to an external server like BitBucket, GitHub or GitLab, they can safely store the repository in a single place.
